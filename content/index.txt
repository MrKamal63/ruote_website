<strong>Ruote</strong> is a workflow engine written in Ruby. Ruote is "not":http://jmettraux.wordpress.com/2009/07/03/state-machine-workflow-engine/ a state machine library.

&nbsp;

Last version is 2.3.0, it was "released":http://jmettraux.github.com/2012-09-03-ruote-2.3.0.html 2012/09/04.

&nbsp;

Here is a re-hash of the "quickstart":https://github.com/jmettraux/ruote/tree/master/quickstart exposing the core concepts in ruote.

Ruote as a workflow engine comes as an "onion". There's a <strong>storage</strong> at the core, taking care of all the persistence. A <strong>worker</strong> where all the orchestration work happens surrounds the core. The <strong>dashboard</strong> has all the levers to launch, pause, cancel process instances.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
require 'rufus-json/automatic'
require 'ruote'
require 'ruote/storage/fs_storage'

ruote = Ruote::Dashboard.new(
  Ruote::Worker.new(
    Ruote::FsStorage.new('ruote_work')))
</pre>

The orchestration work (making the work flow) happens in the worker(s), the orchestrated work (where the added value is) happens in <strong>participants</strong>.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
class Scout < Ruote::Participant

  def on_workitem

    sleep(rand)
    result =
      [ workitem.participant_name, (20 * rand + 1).to_i ]
    (workitem.fields['spotted'] ||= []) << result
    p result

    reply # work done, let flow resume
  end
end

class Leader < Ruote::Participant

  def on_workitem

    workitem.fields['total'] =
      workitem.fields['spotted'].inject(0) { |t, f| t + f[1] }

    puts
    puts "bird:    " + workitem.fields['bird']
    puts "spotted: " + workitem.fields['spotted'].inspect
    puts "total:   " + workitem.fields['total'].inspect
    puts

    reply # work done, let flow resume
  end
end
</pre>

Participant names are mapped to participant implementations via a register call.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
ruote.register /^scout_/, Scout
ruote.register /^leader_/, Leader
</pre>

A <strong>process definition</strong> can be expressed in radial (a mini-language specific to ruote), in Ruby, in XML or directly as a (JSON) abstract tree.

Here is a radial example:

<pre class="brush: ruby">
pdef = %q{
  define
    concurrence merge_type: concat
      scout_alice
      scout_bob
      scout_charly
    leader_doug
}
</pre>

This process definition fans work to three scout participants and then hands the resulting work (item) to the team leader.

Here is the same flow expressed in Ruby:

<pre class="brush: ruby">
pdef = Ruote.define do
  concurrence :merge_type => :concat do
    scout_alice
    scout_bob
    scout_charly
  end
  leader_doug
end
</pre>

Multiple process instances can be launched at the same time. Multiple instances of different processes with different initial workitem fields can be launched in the same system and run in parallel, much like different processes on top of an OS.

<pre class="brush: ruby">
wfid = ruote.launch(
  pdef,
  'bird' => %w[ thrush cardinal dodo ].shuffle.first)
</pre>

Ruote is available under the "MIT":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License open source license.

Ruote used to be named 'openwfe-ruby' then 'openwferu'. The name is now 'ruote' (pronounce it 'ru-o-te' or 'route', as you wish).
